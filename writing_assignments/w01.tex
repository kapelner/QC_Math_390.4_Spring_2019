\maketitle

\noindent Argue for or against one of the following prompts. 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The laws of physics are absolutely true (or not).
\item There exists an all-powerful, all-knowing and timeless being / intelligence (or not).
\item Global warming is real (or not).
\item The optimal human diet for health is [insert a diet here] (or not).
\item People who smoke get lung cancer (or not).
\end{enumerate}

\noindent It is your job to \textit{limit}, \textit{scope} and \textit{concretize} the above which are \textit{deliberately open-ended} and nebulous. You will need to formulate a model with phenomenon(s) that can be measured (explain how) and characteristics of the units under consideration. You will need to clearly define what \qu{models} are and discuss their limitations. In the appropriate context, you must write about the concepts we learned / will learn in class, including but not limited to $t ,f, g, h^*, \delta, \epsilon, e, t, z_1, \ldots, z_t, \mathbb{D}, \mathcal{H}, \mathcal{A}, n, p$, $x_{\cdot 1}, \ldots, x_{\cdot p}$, $x_{1 \cdot}, \ldots, x_{n \cdot}, \mathcal{X}, y, \mathcal{Y}$, the fidelity of the measurement process, extrapolation, interpolation, stationarity, overfitting, validation (in-sample vs. out-of-sample), model selection, machine learning, etc. \\

Specs: Your essay should be at least 10 pages double-spaced with one inch margin, 12pt Times (or Computer Modern if using \LaTeX) and be appropriately organized. Sectioning is at your preference.
